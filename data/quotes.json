  "Even the smallest flame is enough to pierce the deepest night.",
  "Where the world sees ruins, God plants lilies.",
  "Hope is not naive. It is the tether of the soul, firm and secure.",
  "You can be in the storm and still have peace. Thatâ€™s faith.",
  "Faith is the bird that feels the light when the dawn is still dark."
